# Etch-a-Sketch

This project was created as part of the curriculum of **[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)**. It helped me strengthen my skills in **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. 

## Features
- **Dynamic Grid Creation:** Users can input a grid size (from 1x1 to 100x100), and a responsive grid is generated using **Flexbox**.
- **Interactive Hover Effects:** Squares in the grid change color to a random RGB value on hover, with a progressive darkening effect that turns them fully black after 10 interactions.
- **Responsive Design:** The grid adjusts dynamically to maintain consistent square sizes within a fixed container width.

## Key Learnings
- Leveraged **DOM manipulation** to dynamically create and manage grid elements.
- Gained proficiency in **Flexbox** for creating responsive layouts.
- Improved understanding of **event handling** in JavaScript for hover and input interactions.
- Implemented **progressive color transformations** using custom data attributes and random RGB values.
